# AD7606-ADC-Sensor-Library-for-ESP8266
This library provides a simple interface to the AD7606 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) when used with an ESP8266-based board (e.g., NodeMCU). It utilizes hardware SPI to read 8 channels of data from the AD7606, apply custom scaling and error thresholds, and retrieve or print the measured voltages conveniently.
